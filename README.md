## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was the first development project I did.

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
